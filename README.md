Connect landing page for Consultative Competencies

This is the source for a [Github Hosted Page](https://ingagegroup.github.io/consultative-competencies/) for Consultative Competencies, which is published [in an iframe on Connect](https://connect.ingagepartners.com/employeeresources/consultcomp).  We initially wanted to have the HTML and CSS directly on the Connect page, but the Connect HTML component wanted to alter our HTML and CSS when it was saved, and it did not render properly.  In the future, it would be nice if Connect would support "plain old html pages", at which point we could move all of this code into Connect.  But for now...

# TODO
- [X] Finish entering text for competencies
- [ ] Get hexagons responsive to page size
- [X] Hexagons are a little squashed - fix ratio of height / width
- [X] Tooltip hovers (and associated competency description)
- [X] Get tooltips to appear above other content
- [X] Colors are reversed on hover (should be darker when not hovered, lighter when hovered)
- [X] Add titles on each category, per the [design](https://ingagegroup.github.io/consultative-competencies/consultative-competencies-design.png)
- [X] Link each entry click to wiki page
- [ ] Decrease margins between cells in honeycomb (driving me nuts, can't figure it out!)
- [ ] Host this HTML and CSS directly in Connect (if/when Connect supports that)
