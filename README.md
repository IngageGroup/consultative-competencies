Connect landing page for Consultative Competencies

This will eventually be published on Ingage Connect, but for now is viewable as a [Github Page](https://ingagegroup.github.io/consultative-competencies/).

# TODO
- [X] Finish entering text for competencies
- [ ] Get hexagons responsive to page size
- [X] Hexagons are a little squashed - fix ratio of height / width
- [X] Tooltip hovers (and associated competency description)
- [X] Get tooltips to appear above other content
- [X] Colors are reversed on hover (should be darker when not hovered, lighter when hovered)
- [X] Add titles on each category, per the [design](https://ingagegroup.github.io/consultative-competencies/consultative-competencies-design.png)
- [X] Link each entry click to wiki page
- [ ] Decrease margins between cells in honeycomb (driving me nuts, can't figure it out!)
